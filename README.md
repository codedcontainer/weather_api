weather_api
===========
Graphical representation of the weather at a given location using WeatherUndergrounds Api.

Problems
=========
- When loading web page, there is not a center container box or a background.
- What is the meaning behind:
"Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/plain:"

To Do
=======
- Conditions.js place text into simple variables for easier reading.
- Think about formating code using a function. Too redundant.
